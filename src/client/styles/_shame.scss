//There is an interesting concept that has been made popular by Harry Roberts, Dave Rupert and Chris Coyier that consists of putting all the CSS declarations, hacks and things we are not proud of in a shame file. This file, dramatically titled _shame.scss, would be imported after any other file, at the very end of the stylesheet.

/**
 * Nav specificity fix.
 *
 * Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a {}`) which trumps the
 * nav selectors (`.site-nav a {}`). Use !important to override it until I
 * have time to refactor the header stuff.
 */
.site-nav a {
    color: #BADA55 !important;
}
